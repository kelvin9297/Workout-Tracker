This one of my beginner Python project build under the guidance from "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"

This project showcased my understanding and the application of the following Python concepts:

- Working with multiple APIs
- Using environmental variables to hide sensitive parameters such as, API Endpoints, IDs, Tokens, Keys, etc.
- Configure the program to run on a browser-based Python console (Repl.it)
